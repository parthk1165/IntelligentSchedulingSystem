# Intelligent Scheduling System

## Introduction
This project is a part of my final year BE project .
Timetable scheduling is a complex and critical task for educational institutions. It involves the management of various constraints to ensure efficient resource allocation. Manual scheduling is time-consuming, error-prone, and inflexible. Existing solutions are either too expensive, too generic, or too complicated for schools. There is a need for a customized, affordable, and user-friendly software that can automate the scheduling process and optimize the use of resources. In this project, we aim to develop such a software using genetic algorithm and web technologies.
